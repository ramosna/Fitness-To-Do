# Fitness To Do

This project is a single web page that interacts with a database in order to store excercises to be completed by the user. The backend is built using Node.js, Express.js, and mySQL as the database.
The front end web page allows a user add a new excercise to be completed via a form, edit created excercises, and mark them complete when finished. The front end uses, HTML, Bootstrap, and client side Javascript. 

All interactions between the front end and back end are done via AJAX requests. The webpage is never reloaded and all form submission, building of the todo table, and completing activities is done by client side JavaScript and DOM manipulation. 

This project was built as a tool to keep track of my physical therapy exercises after I had knee surgery. It was built to practice using AJAX requests and handling the returned JSON as well as practice with database interactions. 

For a list of depandecies see the [package.json](package.json) file.
